**Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap):**

1. **Home Page:**
   - Display an attractive landing page with a navigation bar.
   - Highlight the purpose of the website and the range of paper bag products available.

2. **Product Listings:**

   - Implement filters or categories to help users narrow down their choices.

3. **Product Details:**
   - Allow users to click on a product to view its details, including larger images, detailed descriptions, and available sizes.

4. **Shopping Cart:**
   - Add a shopping cart icon that displays the number of items in the cart.
   - Enable users to add products to the cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
   - Display the total cost and provide a checkout button.

5. **Checkout Process:**
   - Implement a multi-step checkout process.

7. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the website is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

**Backend (PHP, PHPMyAdmin):**

1. **User Registration and Login:**
   - Create PHP scripts to handle user registration and store user information in the database.
   - Implement secure password hashing using PHP functions.
   - Authenticate users during the login process.

2. **Database (PHPMyAdmin):**

   - Set up tables for users, products, cart items, and orders.

3. **Adding to Cart and Checkout:**

7. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Handle errors gracefully and display user-friendly error messages.
   - Log important events and errors for debugging purposes.

**Deployment:**

- Host the PHP backend on a web server that supports PHP, such as Apache or Nginx.
- Set up a PHPMyAdmin database on a web server to manage the database.

Building an online paper bag ordering system involves both frontend design and backend development, as well as integrating the two components seamlessly. It's a great way to gain experience in full-stack web development and learn how to create user-friendly e-commerce platforms.
